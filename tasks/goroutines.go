// Task: Print Numbers 1 to 10 Using Goroutines

// Write a Go program that uses goroutines to print numbers from 1 to 10. The program should do the following:

// Create two goroutines, printFirstHalf and printSecondHalf, that print numbers from 1 to 5 and numbers from 6 to 10, respectively.

// Use goroutines to ensure that the numbers are printed concurrently.

// Print the numbers in ascending order with a 1-second delay between each number.
